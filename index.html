<h1>Cathy Ho </h1>

<h2>This is my developer story.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My first computer interaction was in 1st grade.</li>
  <li>My teacher showed us how to use the computer to take Accelerated Reader (AR) program that tests our reading comprehension.</li>
  <li>In middle school, I took a keyboard typing class as an elective.</li>
  <li>My teacher did not allow us to look at the keyboard while typing and we had to use keyboard covers. During that time, this was my least favorite class! (haha)</li>
  <li>After graduating college, I became interested in coding at work. My department at work creates mobile health apps.</li>
</ul>
