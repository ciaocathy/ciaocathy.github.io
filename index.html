<h2>This is my developer story.</h2>

<p>
  My first computer interaction was in 1st grade. My teacher showed us how to use the computer to take Accelerated Reader (AR) program that tests our reading comprehension.
  
  In middle school, I took a keyboard typing class as an elective. 

  My teacher did not allow us to look at the keyboard while typing and we had to use keyboard covers. During that time, this was my least favorite class! (hah

  After graduating college, I became interested in coding at work. My department at work creates mobile health apps.
