<h2>This is my developer story.</h2>

<p> My first computer interaction was in 1st grade. <br>
  
  My teacher showed us how to use the computer to take Accelerated Reader (AR) program that tests our reading comprehension.<br>
  
  In middle school, I took a keyboard typing class as an elective. <br>

  My teacher did not allow us to look at the keyboard while typing and we had to use keyboard covers. During that time, this was my least favorite class! (haha) <br>

  After graduating college, I became interested in coding at work. My department at work creates mobile health apps. <br>
